## Running Locally
Using this bot requires that you set up an [app with Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com/ "Apps.Twitter") in order to get API keys. Once you have keys, clone the repository and replace the "process.env.KEY" values in the Twit object with your own keys. 

At that point you should be able to navigate to the main directory of the repository in your command line, and type `node bot.js` to have Silke tweet to your Twitter account!
